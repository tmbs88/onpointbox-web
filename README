# Project Title

With the increasing existence of gyms with classes of different modalities there
is a need to do a prior registration of trainees in the classes in order that they fit the
number spaces for each class depending on the space available and materials available.
This project has as main objectives:
- Computerize enrollment of trainees in existing classes, through a web app;
- Allow trainees to see attendance of classes and free places;
- Allow the export of enrolled class to personal calendar;
- Allow the instructors to remotely see what are his/her classes, enrollment number
and which trainees are enrolled;
- Allow the administrator to manage the schedule of classes, trainees and
instructors;
- Allow the administrator to set a specific time to start enrollment of classes.
